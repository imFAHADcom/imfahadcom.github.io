            <p>There is no doubt that the number of internet users has been steadily increasing, especially with the advancement of network technology and the drop in service costs. With the rise of smartphones, accessing the internet has become easier than ever—no longer requiring visits to internet cafés or relying solely on a home computer.</p>
            <p>This shift gave rise to a generation that was introduced to the internet exclusively through smartphones and social media platforms. As a result, many came to believe that the internet is limited to these platforms and search engines, unaware of the vast depth and breadth of the online world.

This has contributed to the formation of a society that lacks independent thought, passively absorbing what is imposed by the owners of these platforms.</p>
            <p>For this reason, it is essential to explore independent websites—those not controlled by major corporations—and to rely on a variety of sources, rather than follower counts or algorithm-driven content.</p>
