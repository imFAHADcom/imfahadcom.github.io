            <h2>How Tech Companies Killed the Human Desire for Progress</h2>
            <p class="post-date">Published on: June 29, 2025</p>
            <p>In this era of rapid technological advancement, data collection has become a double-edged sword.</p>
            <p>While major tech companies strive to offer advanced services and products that simplify human life, they simultaneously violate personal privacy by gathering and analyzing vast amounts of personal information without clear transparency.</p>
            <p>This behavior has led to a decline in people’s trust in many technological innovations.</p>
            <p>Instead of embracing these advancements, people have become hesitant and avoid them—not out of fear of the technology itself, but because of the hidden surveillance that comes with it. The smartphone or digital assistant is no longer merely a tool for convenience, but rather an open gateway into one’s private life.</p>
            <p>Thus, rather than acting as bridges to the future, these companies have become, in the eyes of many, obstacles that kill the desire for progress.</p>
            <p>Technology should serve humanity, not monitor it; it should respect human freedom, not violate privacy.</p>
